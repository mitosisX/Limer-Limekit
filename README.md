Limekit is a framework developed in Python 3.10 that wraps around the PySide6 (Qt) framework.

But, you don't need to learn Python AT ALL!!

Youll use this program to run all Limekit programs. This includes all Limekit examples and your programs. Download from the Release section (to your right) and download a corresponding zip file for your OS, and open READ ME.txt for more info on how to install.

Limekit is a framework developed in Python 3.10 that wraps around the PySide6 (Qt) framework.

But, you don't need to learn Python AT ALL!!

You'll use the program called Limer (in Limer.zip) to run all Limekit programs and all Limekit examples provided. Navigate to the Release section (to your right) and download a corresponding zip file for your OS (windows-only.zip or linux-only.zip), and open READ ME.txt for more info on how to install. This is the framework that does all the magic.

The Limer.zip is the program for running your programs

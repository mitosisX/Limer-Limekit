Limekit is a framework developed in Python 3.10 that wraps around the PySide6 (Qt) framework.

But, you don't need to learn Python AT ALL!!

You'll use this program to run all Limekit programs. This includes all Limekit examples and all of your apps. Navigate to the Release section (to your right) and download a corresponding zip file for your OS (windows-only.zip or linux-only.zip), and open READ ME.txt for more info on how to install.

The Limer.zip is the program for running your programs

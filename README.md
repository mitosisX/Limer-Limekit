## ⚠️ IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS

Limekit is a framework developed in Python 3.10 that wraps around the PySide6 (Qt) framework. Please download and install python 3.10+ first.
⚠️ Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ before proceeding

⚠️ But, you don't need to learn python AT ALL!! Only lua
⚠️⚠️ At the moment, I do not have a Mac, so, I can not guide you on how to install or run on it ⚠️⚠️

## Where to Download

Navigate to the Release section (to your right) and download the all the files in there (Limer-Limekit.zip, limekit-xx-py3-none-anyany.whl) to get started

## How to install
There are 3 compressed files to download and use.

1. Tools.rar

## Running Apps

You'll use the program called Limer (in Limer-Limekit.zip) to run all Limekit programs and all Limekit examples provided. Inside, you shall find two files (run.bat and run.sh),
you shall use files on Windows and Linux (I don't have access to a Mac, so you can use the run.py for now)

The "run" files only help in debuggind (showing errors on the console), feel free to use the run.py too.

## DONE?
